            <h2>Hello.</h2>
            <p class="introTxt">
                I’m Andrew and I have  a wide variety of skills.  I am an electronics tech, a Unity game developer/artist, and a web developer.  
                I’m also a digital/traditional artist and a musician.  I love learning new skills and figuring out solutions to interesting problems.  
                I enjoy working with microcontrollers and coding solutions for electronics, games, and the web.

                <h3 class"skillT1">Programmer</h3>
                <p class"skillP1">I’ve spent many years learning C# for Unity game development and I have built a wide variety of game mechanics.  I also love to 
                program Arduino using C.  Unlocking the power of the humble Arduino has enabled me to automate the various games in the 
                <a href="https://www.escapegamecda.com">escape game business</a> where I used to work. It is truly exciting to manipulate motors and 
                larger devices using this microcontroller.  I’m currently learning Python, Java, SQL, and mastering HTML and CSS.</p>

                <h3>Musician</h3>
                <p>Starting out in the 4th grade as a clarinet player, I have learned to play many instruments along the way.  
                As a teenager I was all about the guitar, and then during my Air Force years I was all about the Bass guitar.  
                During the last half of my AF career I switched to Keys and I’ve been a keyboard player ever since.  I also 
                love to program synths and I love a good filter sweep.</p>
